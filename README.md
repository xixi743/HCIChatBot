# HCIChatBot
This chat bot helps parents figure out what drugs their teens may be experimenting with based off their symptoms and behaviors. After determining the specific drug the teen is using, we give the parent advice on how to approach the situation.

This chat bot was created for my Human Computer Interaction class; we were asked to create a chat bot that attempts a task that requires a human connection.
